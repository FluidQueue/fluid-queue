    global_limit: 2         # A per-stream limit, enforced by the bot, of how many times this can be redeemed.
                            # Will reset every time the bot is started, or when the bot notices the stream go offline.
                            # Similarly, when this limit is hit, the bot will pause the reward, and unpause it when the bot is started or notices the stream go offline.

    per_user_limit: 1       # A per-user per-stream limit, enforced by Twitch.
    global_cooldown: 180    # A global cooldown on the reward, enforced by Twitch. Specified in seconds.
skip_spacing: 1         # How many levels should be played in between queue-skip levels.
                        # This does not prevent redemptions. This just ensures that the specified number of non-skip levels are played in between skip levels.
