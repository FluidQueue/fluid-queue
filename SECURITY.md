# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

fluid-queue runs on a rolling release cycle, and we are unable to support old versions of the application. We strive to keep all updates backwards-compatible to reduce the impact of updates, and we will follow Semantic Versioning to better signal when an update includes breaking changes. To receive the latest security updates, please run the latest release of the bot.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This repository has enabled [private vulnerability reporting]([link](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)). Please submit any potential vulnerabilities through those channels; you should be able to [start a new report](https://github.com/fluid-queue/fluid-queue/security/advisories/new) to send it to us privately. Please **do not** report a vulnerability as an issue.
